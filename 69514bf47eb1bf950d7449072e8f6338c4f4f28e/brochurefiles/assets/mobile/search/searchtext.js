These changes include the addition of resources that bring diverse talents which have created an exciting work environment.  Proper currently has concurrent projects with Lordstown and Canoo that are beyond anything our organization has tackled including complete product design/development responsibility as a direct OEM supplier. Award of the Lordstown opportunity involves design and production of License Plate Lamps and an Auxiliary Cargo Lamp for the next generation EV truck.  These lamps are being designed with intent for modularity across other OEM vehicle platforms to be sold as an ‘off-the-shelf’ item.  This will be our first turn-key automotive lamp and a perfect introduction to market as we have chosen a commodity that does not compete with our current lighting customers.

Greetings from Canada. To say the last 18 months has been challenging would be a severe understatement. The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged everyone in ways we have never experienced before and hopefully never will again. I would like to take this opportunity to thank our entire team on following all internal and provincial protocols put in place to beat this virus down. I ask that everyone remain vigilant and continue to follow all Public Health advice. Up to this point our facility has been COVID free. Thanks everyone. Great job! As part of our growth initiative as a group, we made some major changes recently. One significant change that we made is the changing of our name from Cutting Edge Precision Services to Proper Tooling!  We want to show the entire industry that we are “One Proper” and are excited to move forward under the Proper name here in Canada. There continues to be a lot of growth in our operation. We currently stand at 98 dedicated associates. One area of concentration was to develop a Program Management team. We have had great success and have added three experienced PM’s to our team in the last 6 months. Our next area to develop would be to start a Feasibility team. Hopefully more news on that in the next Newsletter. When it comes to advancing technology, we have seen some older machines leaving the Component Bay and being replacedwith newer and more efficient machines.  In order to better position ourselves for anticipated growth in 2021 and beyond, we replaced the DMU50, DMU50 ECO and DMU70 machines with the new Quaser palletized 5 axis machining cell.  This cell has allowed us to increase our throughput on themachines whilemaintaining a very high level of machine utilization.

While the sales team is pursuing opportunities to backfill the Electrolux volume for 2021, we are faced with lower sales for 2021 while preparing for enormous growth in 2022 and 2023.  This will challenge the plant to control operating costs as we did during the Pandemic, but also make sure we are investing in our future to support the new program awards for Volvo, BMW, Rehau, and Canoo. This will propel the plant sales to double the current sales volume annually and achieve an important milestone, which is to break into the Tier I market for two large OEM assembly plants (BMW, Volvo). These new programs are for premium brand vehicles which are outlined in the pictures. Notice that three of the four applications are electric. There seems to be a surge in consumer interest propelled by the success that Tesla has generated in the market. Almost every major OEM is now offering an electric vehicle. In the case of Canoo this is a new start-up company with a very innovative approach and this is also a first for the PGM group in that we are “design responsible” for the parts we are producing. This comes with additional responsibility for not only manufacturing but additionally for part performance and warranty. This is a significant change in scope for our company but an exciting challenge to increase our technical capability and further strengthen our position with our customers by creating more value. To prepare for these challenges we have invested millions of dollars in new equipment and processes. Anderson will receive 3 brand new Engel presses and develop its first robotic assembly cell in 2021 /2022. By the middle of 2022 the plant will have significantly changed in appearance and new capabilities. In addition, we have invested in additional resources to support the new launches and avoid any negative impact to existing customers.

At that time, the T1XX, a GMC Serra tail lamp assembly, was our most important program and we were under 3rd party containment due to poor quality. The cost of poor quality to the Pulaski plant significantly affected our profitability. The Pulaski Team came together and addressed the quality issues and applied continuous improvement (CI) techniques. We methodically went through and corrected the variance issues in our inspection procedures, sorting, and criteria for rejects. Then revaluated the packaging of the part to address scuff marks resulting in our changing the process to incorporate a weave method. These actions resulted in the number of rejects dropping to zero in just two months and our being taken off third party sorting. Since then, the Pulaski Team has been successful in applying the same CI methodology to other areas of the plant: • In August 2019, we improved our process on the central feed system eliminating material feed issues that caused the material to break apart and create a black spot on a clear part. • Improved the auto-degating process and equipment to eliminate scratching and inconsistent gate cuts, updated equipment that adjusted the part orientation to perform a more consistent cut, and changed the materials used to grip the part that reduced scratches. • Moved heating/cooling vents from above the crane to below it, resulting in less dust and debris on the rails or in the press, and reducing black spots • Sealed holes in the walls around thermostats to maintain a more constant temperature • Installed automated lift tables and improved cover design to prevent material feed system from starving the press.

This pandemic has effected everyone in some form. We have lost family members, friends, colleagues and neighbors. Through it all we persevered to continue to live our lives, although many have suffered great loss. It will be a time we will never forget. For our company it also took a toll, we started with the GM strikes, the pandemic, floods that created material shortages and now the chip shortage. This has impacted both our manufacturing and technology groups in a significant manner, but we have persevered as you have throughout this time. I am grateful for each person at the company that has helped keep our business running. We did not come out of this unscathed. First and most important we lost colleagues to COVID. Many individuals moved to different positions to support the group and in certain cases we have narrowed our product focus to reduce costs. As the Pandemic subsides, we can see better overall performance ahead for the second half of 2021. This is a true endorsement to the commitment of our team and culture.

Additionally, in February 2021, Texas endured an unprecedented snow storm that caused massive power outages and State of Emergency declarations statewide. This historic event shook the resin industry, forcing almost all major resin and feed-stock manufacturers into declaring force majeure. In the month of March, ¼ of Proper’s Supply Chain had declared force majeure! Despite these many hurdles, the Proper Supply Chain team once again showed their tenacious drive for overcoming adversity and successfully avoided impacting any of our customers’ production lines at all of our manufacturing locations. The team at PGM Anderson rallied together to identify, trial and present alternatives proactively to our customers winning them praise from BMW for being “proactive and diligent” in their actions to protect our customers. The PGM Pulaski team successfully navigated through the majorly impacted Polycarbonate shortage using creative solutions to keep lines running, even supporting some of Proper’s customers with resin as the need arose. The PGMWarren team effectively identified alternatives to their Polycarbonate material and had this back-up tested and on the sidelines should they need to act. The team continues to work through the global shortages as we head back to normalcy over the coming months. Great work team! Projects The last 6 months have been filled with ERP learning for the Supply Chain teams of Manufacturing. The Planning teams, in conjunction with Purchasing and IT, dove head first into launching MRP for the Manufacturing plants. MRP is the first step in expanding our use of the upgraded CSI software for Supplier Management. PGM Pulaski took the lead on this activity by working with the launch team to define the required parameters and process flows in order to generate material requirements and begin reporting out exceptions. Gary Thornton and Kristi Keeton enthusiastically led this activity from their side and successfully launched MRP in February 2021 with a full transition off of those PESKY EXCEL SHEETS in April 2021! Way to go! PGMWarren is just days away from their own launch. After working diligently to input the parameters for all Items while resolving a few system issues with the support of IT, Stacey Holland is gearing up to kiss those excel sheets goodbye in the coming weeks, as well! PGM Anderson is last but certainly not least. Rich Pitoniak and his team began the process of populating parameters and in doing so, have identified an opportunity to further improve the system by automating the scheduling portion in CSI. As we work together on defining and rolling out this next opportunity, PGM Anderson will pave the way for the benchmark process in CSI for scheduling and planning.

This is a customized data base center that will help us reduce paperwork, streamline our processes, eliminate redundant data entry and increase information visibility to thewhole team. This was accomplished by leveraging Microsoft Products such as Dynamics 365 and SharePoint. Along with Microsoft Products we have added Experlogix, which is one of the leading companies in CPQ world (Configure Price Quote). Completed Phases With Phase 1 and 2 completed at the end of May 2021, we have finalized Sales / Estimating section of our Proper Tooling Data Center. Sales Team can now enter Quote Information for New Tooling Quotes in Dynamics 365, as this information will be transferred over to Experlogix and be used by our Estimating Team to complete Mold/Tool Cost as per our customer requests. Addition of new applications to Proper’s arsenal will empower us to deliver customized, accurate and faster tool quotes in this extremely competitive world market. By completing this phase, we have eliminated our Request For Quotation Form 3.1. Eliminating Excel documents and operating from a web-based application will allow us to tie quoting and budgeting activity with purchasing functions. Future Phases As our Tooling Quotes are sent to the customer and these turn into Awarded Jobs, our next phase of Digital Transformation will include converting Quotes to Job Orders which subsequently will become our well known APQP and Change Orders. Along with digitizing APQP we will develop Data Requests, Request for Tryout and all other forms used by Program Management Team. This transformation will be ongoing throughout the rest of the year.  It will modernize and improve the efficiency of our process….working to streamline the flow of information among all stakeholders, from the customers through our program management and design teams, into the manufacturing areas and ultimately to tryout and final ship.

As I write today, on the one-year anniversary of our Windsor plant opening, that plant just surpassed $1 million in sales!  Opening our company in the middle of Covid, a very impressive achievement. From inception, our group has primarily targeted mold makers, trying to sway live work our way – not the easiest way to get sales. We have now shifted our focus; we have a more precise strategy in marketing our services to attack from the top down –OEMandTier 1 focus has been the thrust of our group. With this new focus, our anticipated projects are kicking into high gear - with October to next February looking to be very upbeat in sales. FCA, GM , VW, BMW, Lordstown, Rivian, Toyota, Honda – these OEMs have embraced the void in the industry that we have filled. Magna, Faurecia, NYX, Inteva, TG, MTNA, Adient and ABC are the Tier 1s that are interested in helping us grow our market share. Very significant to our long-term stability and growth has been the development of our exciting exciting new business partnerships around the globe- Germany, Japan, China & Brazil– this global “presence “ has certainly upped the level of play, helped with our exposure here & will help lay the foundation to CST Studio developing into a global, recognizable, reliable supplier. Today, I would like to share one interesting Laser project we did in Clinton Twp. We laser engraved style ribs into a hardened H13 tool, 1 mm deep x 2 mm wide – an unconventional alternative to machining or EDM. The precision aspect of this work was not that – it was that we were able to “extend” the dimensions of several ribs to satisfy the expectations of the OEM designer -  and that is oftentimes not even possible in laser engraving.  Our tech was able to reposition the tool and reposition the laser central focal point to its original position ! And then proceeded to extend the style ribs as needed. A major success for our laser team. Original Burned Ribs – note the gap of between the ribs and the boss feature was inconsistently spaced UNTIL next time,  Cheers from CST Studio!
