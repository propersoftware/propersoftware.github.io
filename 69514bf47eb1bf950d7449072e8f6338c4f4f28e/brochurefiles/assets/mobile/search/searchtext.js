The IEA also predicts the world car count will hit 2 billion between 2035-2040. EV’s will account for approximately 1% of the vehicle population by 2035. Much of the growth in the EV market is driven by government regulatory policies. These policies include credits, subsidies and EV quotas for consumers and manufactures, as well as tightening emission standards and increased fuel taxes. So, basically taking your money and giving it to others to develop a market that might not otherwise exist or grow (I digress). Youmay ask why 1%of the vehicle population is driving somuch hype in the automotive industry. There are a number of reasons for this. Forbes predicts that by 2030 EV’s will account for 28% of the worlds new car sales, and by 2040, EV’s will account for 55% of the total new vehicle sales.  “The pace of electrification in transport will be fastest in Europe, where 44% of light vehicles will be electric by 2030, followed by China (41%) and the US (34%), while Japan will lag behind with just 17% of cars being electric”. The projected growth in the EV market is driving significant investments by the traditional auto manufactures, as well as a number of EV startups. A study performed by AlixPartners in Southfield, MI predicts that by 2023 a whopping $255 billion in R&D and capital expenditures will be being spent globally on electric vehicles, and that some 207 electric models are set to hit the market by 2022. Although Tesla has garnered most of the headlines related to EV’s, there is plenty of competition coming. General Motors announced this year that it plans to deliver at least 20 new EV’s to the market by 2023. Ford announced that they will invest $11 billion to bring 40 fully electric and hybrid vehicles to the market by 2022. FCA announced that it will spend nearly $7 billion to electrify Jeep, Maserati and Fiat brands in the next 4 years. Mercedes-Benzplans to offer at least one electrified alternative in all of its vehicle segments by 2022. Ultimately, Mercedes expects to offer 50 electrified variants. A little over a year ago, Mercedes announced plans to invest $1 Billion in the Tuscaloosa AL facility. Most of this investment will go toward electric SUV’s and a new battery plant. In South Carolina, BMW produces and electric version of the X5. So far in 2018, EV’s have accounted for 7.7% of BMWNorth America Sales. By 2025, BMWexpects that up to 25% of the vehicles they produce will be electrified, including an all new electric X3 from Spartanburg by 2020. BMW is investing in Spartanburg so they can produce EV’s or combustible engine vehicles on the same line. Volkswagenplans 27 electric cars by 2022. Like most other companies, VW is focused on the Europe and China, but are committed to EV production in the US as well. In addition to the investments by traditional automanufactures, money is pouring into private electric companies as well. Funding of private EV companies surged from $200 Million in 2013 to $2 Billion in 2016, and it is only growing from there. These startup includes Rivian, who has raised $500M in investments. Rivian acquired the Mitsubishi plant in Normal, Illinois. They expect their first production vehicles to roll off the line in 2020. In addition to Rivian, there is a slew of other startups looking to get off the ground including Lucid Motors who secured $1 Electric Vehicle Growth and what it means to US!","@ID":6},{"#text":"Proper Tooling |  13","@ID":13},{"#text":"Proper Group 13870 E.

This makes the “Proper” brand older than brands like Google, Facebook, Yahoo and even Apple.  Since “Proper” was founded, very recognizable brands have come and gone …..Saturn and AOL come to mind.  At the start of my career, I worked for companies like Inland Fisher Guide and Detroit Plastic Molding Company.  These places are long gone yet still there is “Proper” …..in the familiar industry leadership position. This is the very definition of a sustainable brand. Most sustainable brands like “Proper” move through increasing levels of sophistication as their companies change. With great brands, core basis of the brand may remain the same but the way in which it is expressed is likely to evolve. Think about Proper Mold & Engineering versus Proper Group International.  “PME” describes a company that designs and builds high quality engineered molds for industry.  “PGI” describes a larger company involved in a more broad range of products..the exact nature of which are better described by its division names; Proper Tooling and Proper Polymers.  We are still “PME”but now we are much more. The branding efforts are part of a larger effort including a new website.  As this evolves over the next few months, we will see the division names change to better reflect the broader base of businesses in which each division will be involved.  In fact, each division will become a “group” in its own right. While this is still evolving and changing, I thought it might be interesting to see  a small sneak preview of our overarching brand ideals. Goal: The goal of developing brand standards and ideals to provide harmony in our message to the community and in how we approach our jobs.  It is the first step in development of an overall marketing message.  The plan for our new brand standard is to reaffirm our core brand values while defining the identity the Proper Group for the future.  This doesn’t just mean presentation materials or logos on your shirts, although this is part of it. This means how we describe and even how you refer to our company. The following presentation of “Logo”, “Brand Identity” and “Brand Vocabulary” have been developed as part of this effort. Brand Logo: “The Proper Group logo is designed to be approachable, conveying the simplicity and precision Proper Group strives for in its manufacturing.  The boldness of “Proper Group” speaks to the durability of its products and strength as a company.” You might note the removal of “International” from the logo.  This makes the logo more simple and bold and reflects the ideal that we are an unabashedly “North American” company.  Brand Identity: Integrity “New is something we never turn away. Built on a culture of creative innovation embracing different product niches, we’re always prepared for what’s on the horizon. Our reputation is staked in our spirit of adaptability and integrity as a partner. And we make it our everyday focus to deliver.” Brand Vocabulary: “The Proper Group brand voice is one of leadership and confidence but should still feel approachable. The following is a list of vocabulary that can be utilized to create messaging for the brand. Adaptive Client Success Collaborative Committed Contemporary Customer First Dedicated Diligent Efficient Imaginative Impactful Innovative Noteworthy Change Partner Passionate Precision Reliable Skilled Support Trustworthy Wide-Spread Impact Conclusion: This is just a short previewof amuch larger rollout taking place over the next few months.  It will culminate in an updated company structure, website and image. While this is still a work in progress, I hope everybody in the Proper Group family finds this interesting and takes some time to think about what “Proper” means to them.  I am proud to have been a small part of the success of this great brand and am excited to be a part of its future.  I hope you are too!

I am sure everyone is looking forward to the arrival of spring and summer.  Time to blow the dust off the Golf Clubs, get the boats out of storage, sharpen up the lawn mower blades and get back to enjoying all the fun outdoor activities. Our team is continuing to evolve.

For example, last fall our leadership team completed a 2 day leadership/conflict resolution training session in effort to continue investing and developing our people and culture.  Our Associates are our greatest asset and over the last several months we have been able to reward some of them with “Job Well Done” awards. These awards are small tokens of appreciation and are given out to Associates who have gone over and above to help and improve the company and/or their fellow Associates.  To all of the recipients, Well Done!! We look forward to handing more of these awards out this year! I am very proud of our Associates for many reasons, one being how generous they are. During the Christmas season our team took on 2 important charity initiatives. First of all, we held a very successful food drive which was donated to “Street Help”; an organization that assists the homeless in Windsor.  In addition to the food drive, we also sponsored a family from the Windsor Children’s Aid Society.  With this initiative, we were able to provide 1 family of four with their entire Christmas wish list!! Things are starting to look up on the business front.  As we all know 2018 was a difficult year in the Mold Business.  As Cutting Edge enters its 19th year in business our entire team is looking forward to a rebound in 2019.  Cutting Edge continues to serve its machining customers in addition to our Proper mold work.  By taking on this machining work, from mainly our Die Cast and Automation customers, we were able to maintain a steady workload on most of our CNC Machines throughout the year. We anticipate that to continue in 2019. The workload in Mold Making is showing some signs of improvement and we are looking to be busy very soon as jobs are starting to be released. Sean O’Neil President Cutting Edge Precision Services","@ID":5},{"#text":"2  | Proper Letter from the CEO I am happy to see the weather break and spring is approaching. With spring comes the rain and fresh blooms of our trees and gardens. It will hopefully also bring a fresh perspective of what is in store for the automotive industry. Autonomous and electric vehicles are being developed at a fast pace. Our OEM customers are finalizing the new product portfolios at a controlled cautious level. In turn, this has put the global tooling industry into a worldwide slow down. This will undoubtedly carry over to slower orders in the part side of our business as well. Our team is expanding their reach into other customers and product lines to help fill open capacity as our customers begin to release new product details. I fully expect the next two quarters to be about the same pace and then ramp to a higher level of capacity utilization. During this time, we will continue to evaluate equipment upgrades, productivity and efficiency in order to compete in the global market. Unfortunately, our government has allowed imported molds from low cost countries to continue to enter our country. So we must continue to improve. In my recent visits to our customers they all have the same message, “There is head winds coming for automotive, maybe in the next 18 to 24 months.”  This is opposite of what the press and cable shows are stating, but these global companies see around the world and I am listening closely.  So much of our company is directly linked to automotive and we will need to be conservative in our behavior to be ready for the next down turn. I hope they are all wrong but it is prudent to prepare. Part of this preparation is evaluating our customers and the products we make for them. Low margin business must be removed from our company, as well as customer behavior that overtakes every resource.  This may reduce overall revenue, but it will make the company stronger and healthier.  We call this weeding the garden! Enjoy your spring season. Geoff O’Brien CEO S E R I E S 4","@ID":2},{"#text":"Billion in investments earlier this year. Even Google is the in EV game with its Waymo company. Waymo’s strategy is to link up with traditional auto manufactures to incorporate their electric and self-driving technology. Their initial focus has been on mini-vans. Waymo plans to launch a driverless taxi service in Arizona this year. Waymo has been testing their vehicles inTexas, California, Michigan, Arizona, Washington and Georgia. This seismic shift in the industry toward EV’s will present both risks and opportunities for automotive suppliers. Here at Proper, we see mostly opportunities in plastic injection molding. BASF, one of the world’s largest producers of plastic resins stated there will be “no electric car without plastics”.  According to Tesla, they expect plastics in EV’s to grow 37% annually. The reason plastics is so strategic to EV’s is increased mileage gained due to lighter weight components. Proper has been engaged in light weighting strategies for several years now. This includes MuCell technology, thinwall development and hybrid injectionmolding with composite fiber technology. Another aspect driving up the plastics content is replacing heavier metal components with lighter plastic components. The Proper Group team is engaged with customers today on light weighting innovations. The challenge is that customers want light weight, better performance and lower cost. This is a huge challenge because lightweight materials come at a premium, andmany light weight technologies require additional capital beyond our standard injection molding machines. Somebody has to pay for this. Some of you may be familiar with our Fiber Form Cell in Warren’s plant 3. Last year, Proper, along with its technology partners developed a new version of the Ford F150 Console Lid. Our team did a fantastic job redesigning the products and tools, as well as the manufacturing process to incorporate a high strength, light weight fiber sheet in the molding process. The entire Fiber Form cell in Warren’s building 3 was displayed prominently at the 2018 North American Plastics Expo (NPE) last spring.  This cell has generated significant interest from our customers because it resulted in a 15% weight reduction and a 40% improvement in strength. We are currently working with a customer on a Fiber Form concept for a structural component on the F150. Although it is a work in process in process, we are currently seeing a weight reduction in excess of 40%. We also see an improvement in strength of 24%. The down side is that our current cost model shows the light weight part will cost approximately 20% more to produce than conventional injection molding. In some cases, customer might accept higher cost if they perceive a higher value in the product. Even so, we are working to close the price gap. The bottom line is that the move toward EV’s will only accelerate the use of plastics in the vehicles and that is good news for the Proper Group. The future will be both challenging and exciting, the way we like it. Bring it on!!

Going forward, all new molds have been started under our team of Chris, Al and Phil. The market remains slow but we are starting see improvements in quality, timing and customer satisfaction. This is a great starting point and I would like to thank everyone and remind you all that your continued support of the supervisors and management team, along with your dedication to quality is what makes this work. Since the start of the 1st quarter we have completed (20) new molds with an on-time performance of 95%.  All tools were on time or early with the exception of #15808. Overtime will be continued to be managed closely by department based on workload. Bay#1 has been working (7) days for several weeks.  We are starting to see their workload return to normal as new orders have been completed.  As our new project backlog has picked up, machine utilization and consequently work hours in all machining areas are increasing.  Anyone with any questions regarding workload / backlog please, see your supervisor or me directly. The recent Ford CX 430 Prototype program (19 Molds) has started a culture change within our company.  Prototype work used to be characterized as overflow work and lower priority.  With this program, we have taken steps to integrate the planning and execution strategy to involve the entire company.  This will provide a better service to our customers and allow both prototype and production tooling areas to thrive.   Prototype aluminum tools are now tracked and scheduled in the same manner as production tools, with larger molds machined complete in B1 with the same priority.  The programs being quoted are too large for one building to machine and build therefore the jobs are being quoted for all of Proper build. This provides internal opportunities, increases capital utilization and increases Proper Group’s customer base which is a big advantage in cyclical markets like automotive.   Prototype success can also lead to future production orders as well. This is a great example of working as one company versus acting as separate divisions. We will continue to strive to spread this type of activity to all areas of the company, including PGIM and Anderson. As I outlined in the previous newsletter our initial goals are simple; • Eliminate any current job liabilities ASAP. (Molds need tryout issues closed out) • Develop current system ASAP making sure job assignments are clear and there is accountability. • Do it right the first time. Eliminate rework. • Interface Chris, Al & Phil in the new builds at the right time so more eyes are on the project and they can assist to steer the job in the right direction. • Make ALL due dates. To build on this additional required goals are; • Increase utilization of equipment. • Maximize 3D printing utilization. • Consistent shop & machine cleanliness. • Overall organize entire shop all bays / departments. • Improve mold designs, content and update Proper standards with regular team meetings. All of the above are well underway with much work left to complete.

Supplies are in clear sight to we know the status for replenishment.  Fans were mounted to replace floor units, which were hard to clean around and created trip hazards. Physical barriers for RH and LH part separation were implemented to reduce the risk of mixing parts. Condition lights were mounted on every machine and the PCA uses this to communicate to the support team; each color represents a condition and/or request for help by a support team member.  This is all designed to make the work station safe, efficient, and error proof. We cannot forget about material quality, we installed new covering systems to control contamination to our resins.  This makes it easy to see how full a Gaylord is and simple to replace when new material is needed. Taking care of raw material is a critical step to achieve the levels of quality our customer requires.  Achieving these requirements at a profit is the end game.
