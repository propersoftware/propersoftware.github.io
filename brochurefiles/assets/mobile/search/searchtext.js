In November, a foundation was poured for the new machine.  The machine arrived late November and was operational the first week of February. Proper also purchased a new state of the art tool presetter for greater tool accuracy and speed.  It is as accurate as any laser and is not subject to all of the damage when attached to a machine.

In addition to launching over $100M in new, life-time production awards, the team acquired over $120M in additional life-time production awards.  The Tooling and SC production operations ran into the “perfect storm” in the 4th  quarter with all the G01 tooling coming due for the customers first preproduction part requirements. Things have not slowed up much in the 1st quarter of 2017.  It was a big effort across the board to ensure we met our customer’s delivery requirements. The future is no less exciting.  To support the company’s future growthandthe“OneProper”initiative,ourBusinessDevelopment Team has been organized into (4) focused Business Units… Lighting, Exteriors and Technical Products, Premium Consumer Products and Tooling. The Exteriors and Technical Products Group is led by Neil Yanik. Neil and his teamhave been front and center on the launch of the G01/02 programs.  This effort will continue through this year. The start of production for the G01 base vehicle is in August of this year. Our company has gained incredible insight and experience in what it takes to manage this level of business.  Our design and development team, led by Jim Lake and Mike Tabbert spent significant time early on in 2016 working directly with BMW and their design groups to get the product design right.  Our Polymer Tooling and Technical team spent many weeks in China and Germany following tools being built outside the US.  The Proper Tooling Team has managed a significant amount of the new tool builds and managed the landing and support of the tools building in China and Germany.  Recently, a senior Director of Purchasing and his team from BMW visited our SC plants.  His initial response was “Wow”.  To say the least, he was extremely impressed with what the Proper Group has accomplished. Even though the team was busy with the BMW launch, they managed to secure additional business which is projected to be over $21 Million over the life of the programs. Most all of this business was for a new customer (SMP) for new Mercedes Benz programs. Looking forward, the Exteriors and Technical plastics group will look to capitalize on the exposure and experienced gained over the past year.  Our Polymers Team has been approved by Volvo and we are currently in pursuit of a number of direct opportunities for Volvo and their new plant in Charleston SC. In addition to moving up stream on the customer base, this business unit continues to look for new technologies in areas of composite structures and coatings to increase the value proposition to the customer. The Lighting Business Unit is led by Dan Dare.  The Lighting Business Unit acquired over $80 Million life time sales in new business in 2016.  In addition, this unit added 3 new customers to their lineup.  Over the past year, the Lighting Group has grown from a part supplier to a player in the molding, coating and assembly of complex lighting products.  The Pulaski Plant is currently being expanded to add molding & assembly capacity and add a hard coating line.  The added capabilities of hard coating and assembly have put the Lighting Group in a unique position among the supply base.  We are truly full service from tooling, to the delivery the final product for small lamp assemblies, including Fog Lamp Assemblies and Photo Electric Scanning Units.

This development/R&D project is an ongoing vision to a lighter vehicle without compromising structural strength or performance.  The truly exciting part for Proper Tooling,  as an injectionmold tool shopand injectionmolder, that these types of technologies are replacing, normally sheet metal stamped parts with plastic injection molded parts. Light, high-performance plastics today are so stable that they can replace heavy metals in automotive construction. In addition they are rust-free and flexibly formable, which allows for the implementation of new design concepts and better integration of other components and functions. This Process is a combination of draping, forming and over mold injection molding.  The sheet stock supplied by Lanxess is a woven glass –reinforced high-performance composite sandwiched between a layer of polypropylene. The sheet stock used for this application was only 0.5mm thick. In order to obtain some measurable data in comparison to a scenario, before and after, a current Door Carrier design was used and modified to fit this process.  With early measurable information, the new Door Carrier is 37% lighter and has passed the first build and structural testing performed. Here is the general process.","@ID":28},{"#text":"18  | Proper Polymers Anderson Proper Polymers Anderson finalized the commissioning of the new 1150 ton Krauss Maffei (see pics New KM, New KM 1, New KM 2).

After more than a year of planning, designing, and building; the team was excited to officially release the new version of their tool tracking and collaboration app dubbed “ToolStats 2.0”. Equipped with a re-designed user interface, new security features, and upgraded collaboration tools; the new version of that app now makes tracking your tools and working with your supply chain easier than ever before. The first stage of the launch included a closed beta period where a select group of customers were able to use the app and test out the different tracking features using live data. With any new software release, meticulous testing is required to ensure functionality and usability operates as designed. Having customers involved throughout this process not only gave the teamextra resources for testing, but it also allowed for immediate feedback from the users the product was designed for. The second stage of the launch involved the training & on-boarding of existingToolStats users onto the new site. Because some of the current customers had over 200+ tools already being managed on the old site, it was imperative that their service and workflows weren’t interrupted and that it was a seamless transition to the new app. The programming team was responsible for migrating all existing files, logs, alerts, and tracking details over to the new database for over 2,000 tools as well; which was a critical process to ensure none of the customer information was lost. The 3rd & final stage of the launch was a combination of putting the final touches on system features for the new site and officially retiring the old website and mobile apps. Needless to say, the team is thrilled to put the old version behind us, and looking forward to continuing to build innovative solutions on a platform they designed in-house from the ground up. The business team will be setting up time with the appropriate Proper divisions to train employees on the new site throughout the next quarter. I want to give a special thanks to Mike Taulbee, Stan Vespie, and Agu Nwosu for their excellent work throughout this entire process. Thank you! Product development wasn’t the only exciting things happening with ToolStats. The business team added two new members to the group to increase their sales & customer service efforts. Eric Stoller joined the team in March as an account manager. Previously at iHeart Media, Eric was responsible for digital ad sales and marketing for the company; which makes him a great fit for this type of product line. Also joining the team was Kansas Raby, who previously worked as a receptionist for Proper at their Warren headquarters. Kansas will be responsible for customer service and assist with the on-boarding of new customer accounts. Please help me with welcoming Kansas & Eric to the ToolStats team!
