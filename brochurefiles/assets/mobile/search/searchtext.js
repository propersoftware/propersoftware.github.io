Al and Phil will be in charge of both new builds, as well as, ECS and Corrections. Associates in the assembly area have already been assigned to either Al or Phil with some flexibility based on workload and customer requirements. The benching & spotting associates will also work closely with both Al and Phil. The same applies to the entire night shift in assembly, benching and spotting.  Al will handle primarily Lighting and Multi-Action molds; Phil will handle Interior and Exterior trim molds. After the new builds are sampled, the same molds will go back to the original leader to handle ECS and/or corrections. These moves and assignments should provide more consistency and also improve efficiency and quality. Chris will oversee all of the above in addition to coordinating daily day and night lineups, managing all incoming change orders, handling customer off sight support requirements, new hires, and associate training. Our goals are simple; • Eliminate any current job liabilities ASAP. (Molds need tryout issues closed out) • Develop and enhance our current system ASAP making sure job assignments are clear and there is accountability. • Do it right the first time. Eliminate rework. • Interface with Chris, Al and Phil in the new builds at the right time so more eyes are on the project and issues are resolved early to steer the job in the right direction. • Make ALL due dates. With your support, we can develop an efficient teamvery quickly, get our past issues resolved, maximize throughput and get the profit margins where they need to be. Any suggestions you may have, please bring to myself, Chris, Al or Phil. Your cooperation and assistance in supporting Chris, Al and Phil in these assigned roles is appreciated. Going forward, we expect the workload to pick up late summer, so our window of time to make big changes quick is small. We need to focus, prioritize and act now. Thank You.

Combine the internal changes to manage the growth, with the ever changing shifts in customer diversity and requirements; this statement has never been truer than it is today.  Over the last 18 months Proper has increased sales, incorporated new technology, and added asset infrastructure at a record pace.  With over 200 part launches coming to a close and into the start of production, the size of the part making business has tripled.  This growth has required an increase in facilities footprints, extensive investment in capital equipment, and additional technologies. These new technologies have come in the form of hard-coating, assembling of full lamps, foaming and gluing of commercial coolers, and auto flaming of exterior body components. As normal these launches have come with a few bumps and missteps that challenged our team. The team has stood strong and delivered on significant achievements and consistently met tough commitments. We still have a few challenges remaining. Now is the time to push forward. Working together through these launches we will take our lessons learned to improve our launch and administrative processes to be successful with the next wave in our business. I believe we have a great group of people dedicated to executing our strategy.  I am proud of our teams, that when faced with adversity, seem to find ways to think outside the box and be innovative. Continuing with this approach will help us all accomplish our internal goals, and never lose sight of our most important responsibility: Our Customer. Putting it all together - our goal is to develop people and grow a culture that strengthens Proper’s ability to be the standard of technology and customer loyalty by which every other company is judged.

Over the last decade the injection molding industry has witnessed Automotive and Consumer Products customers try to cut prototype out of their build/ development process, with no real or efficient success.  \"Nice Try\", who wouldn't like to bypass a process and save time and money getting to the final product. bypass a process and go from Design straight into Production Tooling saving time and money.  Now we do not want to get lost in a paradine shift and think that nothing will or needs to change, for we live in a time were change is constant, \"If your not changing, you are dying\". New ideas are exciting, but they do need to be proved out and developed apprropriately. This is were a prototype is key in the design and development process which then leads to the final tooling and manufacturing phase. What is  Prototype? A prototype is the first full-scale and usually funtional form of a new design. Why Prototype? There are a number of good reason's to prototype a new idea/design. 1) Fail early and inexpensivley - Real innovation always includes a risk of failure. By building a prototype, you can quickly weed out the approaches that don't work to focus on the ones that do. 2) Gather more accurate requirements - Almost half of all project costs are attributted to rework due to inadequate requirements.  By developing a working prototype, you can demonstrate the functionality to help solidify requirements for the final design. 3) Technically understand the problem - By developing a functional prototype, you are forced to address both the foreseen and the unforeseen technical challenges of a devices design.  Then, you can apply those solutions to a more elegant system design when you move elegant system design when you move to the final deployed solution. 4) Resolve conflicts - By taking advantage of a prototyping platform, you can quickly conduct several different implementations of the feature and benchmark the resulting performance to analyze the trade-offs of each approach. This can save time, but it also ensures that you make the correct design decisions A prototype works as hard proof that an idea will or won't work. Over the last 6 months, Proper Tooling Prototypes division has beenworking hand and hand with Otter Box, developing, tweeking, producing parts and doing the full assembly on over 1,100 prototype Fresh Box collapsible \"Soft Cooler\".  It was a great project in many ways.  It was profitable, it gave Proper the opportunity to get more engaged/experience with full assembly projects and we got the opportunity to build a relationships with another good customer, \"Otter Box\". \"Why Prototype\"","@ID":16},{"#text":"Proper IT |  35 Security Services Dashboard Date: 07/30/18 Serial: Global Viruses Blocked Over Time: Last 6 Months Top Viruses Blocked Hits MM/YY Virus Name Percentage of Viruses Cutwail.AP 6% ******************************************* Braincrypt.A 6% ****************************************** Suspicious#polycrypt.11 5% ************************************ MalAgent.H_7814 4% ****************************** Virut.A_1064 3% ******************** SweetIM.A_6 2% ****************** Suspicious#polycrypt.13 2% ****************** Polip.gen 2% ***************** RiskWare.A_100 1% ********** OptimumInstaller.A_2 1% ********** Intrusions Prevented Over Time: Last 6 Months Top Intrusions Prevented Hits MM/YY Intrusion Name Percentage of Intrusions SIP friendly-scanner User-Agen... 24% ******************************************* SIPVicious Activity 1 9% **************** GNU Bash Code Injection (CVE-2... 8% ************** Web Application Directory Trav... 8% ************** SIPVicious Activity 2 4% ******* ZeroAccess P2P Activity 1 2% ***** PING Reply (ICMPv6) 2% **** PING Request (ICMPv6) 2% **** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Att... 2% **** Suspicious HTTP Host Header 1 1% ** Spyware Blocked Over Time: Last 6 Months Top Spyware Blocked Hits MM/YY Spyware Name Percentage of Spyware Malformed-File js.XW.2 36% ******************************************* Malformed-File js.ZY.2 33% *************************************** Malformed-File js.XW.1 19% *********************** Malformed-File js.ZY.1 9% *********** HTML5 Vibration API 0.6% * WebMiner_Cryptonight 0.1% * Malformed-File swf.ZY.1 0.0% * Bundled-Software WAV-MP3 Conve... 0.0% * Utorrent.PAF 0.0% * Obfuscated-File js.OT.33 0.0% * Multimedia (IM/P2P) Detected/Blocked Over Time: Last 6 Months Top Multimedia Detected/Blocked Hits MM/YY Multimedia (IM/P2P) Name Percentage of Multimedia (IM/P2P) BitTorrent Protocol -- UDP Act... 10% ******************************************* Google Play -- HTTPS Activity ... 5% *********************** Apple iTunes -- SSL Traffic it... 4% ******************** Google Play -- QUIC protocol 4% ******************* YouTube -- HTTPS googlevideo.c... 3% **************** Google Play -- DNS Query play.... 3% ************** Skype -- DNS Skype 1 2% ********** YouTube -- UDP googlevideo.com 2% ********** YouTube -- DNS googlevideo.com 2% ********** Netflix -- DNS Query netflix.c... 2% **********","@ID":35},{"#text":"20  | Proper Group International Greenville What was once a vision of Geoff O’Brien and Mark Rusch some 4+ years ago, to build a new state of the art Injection Molding operation in Greenville, SC., has now just finished its first full year of operation.

Our domestic auto manufactures, we used to call them the “Big 3”, not sure what we call them now, continue to invest and upgrade plants in the north. Huge investments by the tiered supply base has followed and combined they have literally transformed towns and cities like Greenville, South Carolina. Fortunately, the ownership of Proper Group had the foresight to recognize this trend early on. Our Anderson SC plant was built in 1996. And as most of you know, Proper has made significant investments in facilities in Pulaski TN and Greenville, SC. With Plants in Warren, MI, Pulaski TN and the Carolina plants, Proper Group is within 5 hours of nearly every major auto plant in the north and south. Proper Polymers Greenville and Anderson will supply approximately $27M worth of product into the BMW plant in Spartanburg SC alone. They will supply nearly $5M worth of product that goes into the Mercedes plant in Tuscaloosa AL. Proper Polymers Pulaski delivers a majority of its products to customers in TN and AL. The future investment in new vehicles going into the southern states in the coming years is quite significant. Between 2019 and 2026, BMW projects to launch 11 new vehicles or major vehicle enhancements. In addition to its all new electric vehicle development, Mercedes plans on 8 new vehicles or major vehicle enhancements. Volvo, with its new plant in Charleston has a plan for up to 4 vehicles out of this plant. And this is from just 3 of the auto manufactures. The new is not all bad for Michigan and the northern states. Ford has poured nearly a billion dollars into its Michigan Assembly Plant, in Wayne, MI, for the reintroduction of the Bronco and Ranger. GM recently announced it is investing 100’s of millions of dollars in its Cadillac plant, located in LansingMI. Here, GMwill continue tomove the product portfolio away from cars and focus on Cross Overs and SUV’s. In Michigan, FCA is investing more than $1 billion to modernize the Warren Truck Assembly Plant to produce the next generation Ram Heavy Duty truck, whichwill relocate from its current production location in Saltillo, Mexico, in 2020. This investment is in addition to the announcement made in January 2017 which committed to spending a portion of $1 billion in Warren Truck Assembly to expand the Jeep® product line with the addition of the all-new JeepWagoneer and GrandWagoneer. Michigan is number one in the nation in manufacturing jobs created since 2009. The bottom line is we are still the “Motor City” baby!

The age of mobility is upon us and it will change the way we think and use cars in the future. I have spent some time with our customers and industry experts to see what this will mean to our company.  First the age of electrification will continue.  35% of all vehicles sold in 2025 will be electric.  If autonomous will become a reality, then the number of cars per household will drop.  Ownership will drop and riding will be a user experience event.  So if you are going to work you may hail an Impala, but for date night you may hire a Lincoln Navigator.  This will all be managed by your phone to a level that will make Uber look out of date. Proper will be positioned well, as we continue our drive in supporting the vehicle lighting market.  New light requirements will be required to let pedestrians know the car is in autonomous mode, as well as communication that the vehicle sees the people nearby. Comfort lightingwill be enhanced in the cockpit because you can now do other activities such as reading or watching videos.  Both segments, tooling and part making will benefit. Exteriors will change less driving the tool business down, but the part business up because the cars will run much longer and a lot more.  Powertrain companies will have to reinvent itself as combustion engines are eliminated.  More opportunities will emerge in battery cooling and recharging technologies.  As this market develops, I can assure each one of you that we will be involved in the future of automotive. Our tooling group had quite a slow summer with the market place down. Many of the OEM customers have moved programs back which causes gaps in our deliveries.  I am happy with the recent progress of our new orders and I expect this fall and winter to be very busy in all locations. We also had some management changes but I will let you read the article for more detail.  Polymers has tremendous growth and we are finally settling in with a strong and committed team. We actually put the brakes on any new projects for the last 12 months, while we absorbed hundreds of new product launches. Now we are back to building, our future order book with new customers like Yeti, Valeo and Honda.  You will read more on this inside.

Volvo announced plans to build and new plant in Charleston, SC. Toyota and Mazda announced a joint venture manufacturing facility in Huntsville, AL. Also, Mercedes-Benz announced that they will be producing all new Electric SUV models at a new facility in Tuscaloosa AL as part of a 3 continent, 6 plant electric vehicle strategy. In addition, Mercedes announced that they will build an all new battery factory in AL to support its electric vehicle manufacturing. BMW’s, Spartanburg, SC plant has the capacity to produce over 400K vehicles and is the largest export plant in the USA by sales value. In 2000, the total US Vehicle production was over 12M vehicles. Approximately 77% were built in northern states, of which, Michigan built nearly 25% of all vehicles manufactured in the USA. In 2000, the southern states had 23% of the market. In 2018, U.S. vehicle manufacturing is expected to hit just over 11M according to HIS. The southern states are expected to produce 43% of these vehicles. The south gained nearly 2M vehicles over the past 18 years. Michigan alone lost 1M vehicles. Sales","@ID":36},{"#text":"Proper Group International |  23 2 2.

Cybersecurity includes many areas including I/T services to block harmful emails and virus programs that change daily. So far this year, our e-mail content filter servers have screened millions of e-mails into SPAM, or quarantine to help you clear them without I/T help. A major step to advance our ability to combat the bad guys is YOU and your awareness when something seems “fishy”, or strange.  The industry term“Phishing” is used to describe e-mail fishing for someone to respond.  They try to trick you using a familiar E-mail sender’s name masked as a Proper executive or your common associates’ names.   An easy way to identify a masked e-mail is look at the real address next to the person’s name. Example – email headers normally have @propergrouptinl.com or @proper.net, not something else: a) From: Geoff O'Brien <mms@message-tmomail.net> (BAD) b) (GOOD) ALWAYS - Error on the side of caution, and question anything suspicious with your manager, I/T or better yet the sender to verify it was real. Job well done for those of you not clicking on malicious links and reporting/deleting spam.  In the last six months we’ve seen an improvement to our overall phish-prone percentage.  Six months ago, 15% of our associates would be tricked into clicking a malicious link/email, today we have reduced that down to 5%!

Advancements include visibility to the work scheduled in design, outsource, PGIM, CEPS, program management and try out area.  The system now includes all change orders. Visibility to change orders in the schedule has made a positive impact to understand machine capacity for planning and impacts to job timing and customer communications. The scheduling team offers training on the software which consists of a “User Interface” program to start/pause/ stop jobs and change jobs to alternate machines.  Supervisors have access to detailed order and schedule information by way of a viewer program showing actual capacity utilization, scheduled operations and complete access to the scheduling tools (just no “Save” button). The scheduling team inputs the work order information using job templates for each key group of operations and manages changes along the way with the whole team.  They are there to help anyone with JobPack. For everyone, Proper I/T developed a dashboard program to search job related information for all users.  No licenses are required, just a web browser link to JPCORE/.  The dashboard offers downloadable MS-Project and Excel output.  Job information can be searched to show progress at each operation and logbooks to scheduled resource terminals that define our work centers, machines, designers, purchasing, assembly and try out to name a few. We appreciate everyone’s efforts to make JobPack a success as many of you input job timing into the user interface program and indicate important milestone completion steps that allow others to see if a job is on-track or approaching a risk point. STEP FILE VIEWER - BLY Our initiative to simplify design document exchange, reduce replication, and lower costs related to the creation and storage of multiple file formats resulted in an enterprise decision to use “STEP” as our internal standard.  Our CAD system, Cimatron, produces STEP files to exchange data with the manufacturing systems like Tebis and others that don’t naturally exchange in the same format. STEP is defined as “Standard for the Exchange of Product Data” and is the successor to older IGES formatted files. STEP model files often use the .STP file extension. To quickly view STEP files, our design leadership worked with I/T and selected BLY as the Proper standard software to quickly and easily view a file.   You will see BLY as the associated file type which automatically brings up the viewer program. Please help us support the corporate initiative to avoid using IGES internally and reduce overhead, cost and replication.  The IGESTOOLBOX program is no longer supported in the industry. PURCHASE ORDER REQUISITIONS In January, we launched an enterprise wide program to replace paper Purchase Order Requisitions and advance the way we grant approval thru the necessary channels.  The program uses the Microsoft Azure cloud platform Dynamics 365.  Dynamics provided a quick means to configure our paper form on a web screen and ultimately produce a PDF/Word representation of the PO once approved thru the proper channels.   The vendor approval process was also incorporated in Dynamics to reduce paper flow and automate manual processes. In the first six months, we processed over 3,400 PO requests thru Dynamics. We continue to improve the work flow using reminders and e-mail notifications to help stay on-track. We appreciate your support in making the system a success in the way we reduced paper costs and simplified manual process.  Special thanks to the Purchasing Department for working together to build a better system. MANUFACTURING EXECUTION SYSTEMS - POLYMERS A major step to advance our manufacturing process in the Polymers plants incorporated a new system named “Earn-A-Label” or EAL.  The system was first piloted in Greenville in late 2017. Subsequent versions were deployed in Anderson and Pulaski in early 2018. EAL tracks production and creates label for containers and parts in a real time, accurate manner.

Features include; built-in CAD and simulation viewers, design file revision log, customizable qualification forms, various scientific molding tests, and alerts to make sure the entire supply chain is aware of the current status of a program. The team is actively looking for customers and partners to help co-develop these new solutions with. The product development team did a fantastic job managing these two development projects, and was able to design and build mock-ups for both RJG Stats and ToolStats 4.0 in a matter of weeks. This allowed the business team to demonstrate these new ideas live at NPE; which definitely created some buzz at the show. Oh yeah, a design refresh of both our iOS and Android mobile apps were also built and published prior to the show as well. Great work by the product team to get this all accomplished with tight deadlines, and a lot of eyes on the projects. Q2 also brought a handful of new companies to the roster of ToolStats users. Edwards Lifesciences; which is a global top 50 medical manufacturing company, signed their first service agreement and is currently rolling out the product across their supply chain. Inalfa Roof Systems is now an official ToolStats customer, and will be requiring it on new tools moving forward. The account management team also on-boarded 4 new Magna Exteriors divisions, bringing the total number of Magna plants using ToolStats to 25. The new divisions include two plants in Mexico, Magna Celaya and Decoplas, and two plants in China, Magna MCC Wuhu and Shanghai. Needless to say, the value of ToolStats is spreading, and the number of users being onboarded continues to grow at a rapid pace. We’re looking forward to carrying this momentum into the second half of the year, and continue our mission of helping companies better manage and track their tooling information.
