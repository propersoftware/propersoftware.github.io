The demand for mobile equipment is increasing which sparks a concern.  While the majority of associates use desktops, many of you have laptops, tablets, and mobile phones.  Mobile equipment is more susceptible to damage and theft; therefore, you should take these steps to protect both your laptop and your data. • Never leave confidential data on your laptop • Never leave your laptop unguarded in a public place • Never leave a laptop bag on a car seat in plain view • Company data should NOT be stored on your laptop and should be stored on a company network drive.  Laptop hard drives are not protected while network drives are.   This not only applies to laptops but desktops as well. • Notify IT immediately after any incident Regardless of the precautions, you take, a laptop may still get lost or stolen. So it’s vital to keep the loss to a minimum by ensuring your data is protected.

What was good enough yesterday is not good enough today.  The industry is requiring tooling that is more complex, built at a faster pace and at a lower price.  Proper ToolingWarren has established a Process Improvement Team to address our ever changing business. The team consists of representatives from all areas of engineering and manufacturing.  They are challenged with meeting the industry expectations while producing tools at a faster pace and at a lower cost. One of the projects they are working on is the transformation of electrode manufacturing. Darren Mack, Scott Fair and the Electrode team have taken on the mission of producing electrodes faster and at the lowest cost possible.  They are using the principles of Lean Manufacturing and 6S to guide them on their mission.  A newMakino F5 milling machine was added replacing an older machine to improve downtime and adding Stability to the process. The milling room has been painted, obsolete items are being removed and the remaining items are being organized in an efficient and effective manner.  The hard part comes next, Process Improvement; what is the most effective way of producing electrodes?  The team is mapping the current process and work flow to understand the costs and identify areas for improvement.  Using this study they will focus on the large cost items first.  They have already identified milling as a large item and have integrated Cimatron’s VoluMill software into the process.  The initial findings are showing a 45% reduction in electrode milling time withVolumill. This reduction is great but the cost of the software, cutters and cutter life must be taken into the equation before we know that it is truly a cost savings.  A second area they are focusing on is lights out manufacturing during the nights.  The electrode milling machines are robotically loaded, by programming and setting up the robots during the days, the robots can run unmanned at night.  For this to happen a structured process must be created and followed.  It appears the Electrode team is on the right path for success and I look forward to seeing what they will come up with next. If you have ideas or items you think the Process Improvement Team should look at please let us know.

It is a tough and costly task to meet new guide lines on more efficient vehicles. We areworking onweight reductions in the vehicle by lightening up interior and exterior components. Exteriors are going from steel panels to aluminum panels. Interiors, parts are thinning, foaming and trimming down. Recently, Proper Tooling Prototype division has complete the prototype tooling for the Ford U554 Rear Applique program and we are currently assembling the full Rear Applique in house for our customer Automotive Lighting.  Photo’s of the Unlit and Lit Rear Applique assembly are shown. The lighting aspect of the vehicle, is a specialty that Proper Tooling knows very well and excels in. The new efficient direction that automobile lighting industry is venturing down is exciting for it not only offer efficient aspects but also can add eye catching design and style to the vehicle.  This direction is LED’s. LED stands for “light emitting diode.” A diode is an electrical component with two terminals which conduct the electricity only in one direction. With an electrical current, the diode emits a bright light around the small bulb. Proper Prototype The old and faithful incandescent light bulbs are being forced out of automotive lighting, to be replaced by LED lights. LEDs can be installed in ways and in locations that are impossible with incandescent and fluorescent lighting. The LEDs have a number of advantages over incandescent lighting that are very attractive for automotive use: • They are very insensitive to vibrations • They last for the life of the vehicle (does not apply to headlight LEDs yet) • They can be baked into moisture proof casings to be installed in all kinds of harsh environments • They light up much quicker than incandescent bulbs • They are extremely compact • They can be made to emit different colors • They run cool • They give more light per supplied watt than incandescent light bulbs • They allow the design to be creative in an area that was traditionally boxed in","@ID":20},{"#text":"10  | Proper Innovation innovation Proper Innovation is investigating a mid-plane mesh generator for ‘Autodesk Moldflow Insight’ that is synchronized with Cimatron’s QuickSplit functionality.  The traditional Moldflow model generation is classified as ‘dual domain mesh’ which is 300,000 plus elements and takes approximately 15 hours to run a single analysis to define gating.  This process may take several attempts to balance internal cavity pressures and ensure structural integrity of our highly engineered tooling. An alternative modeling method is available thru Moldflow and involves 15 to 20 hours of manual modeling, but cuts the analysis time by 90%.  The one-dimensional method is referred to as a ‘midplane mesh’ and consists of a single sheet surface representing a prescribed part thickness. With the help of integrated Cimatron tools, themidplanemesh is reduced to 90,000 elements, modeling time of 4 hours, and cuts the run time to 2 hours.  Simulation accuracy is within 95% of a ‘dual domain mesh’ on product with uniform nominal wallstock across the entire part.  Listed below is the outlined procedure for this process to create a ‘midplane mesh’ from 3D geometry utilizing tools within our current Cimatron software package. 1). User imports model and establishes die vector. 2). Cimatron splits model cavity to core thru UCS function. 3). User has the ability to review each individual half, and defines which half is preferred. 4). User defines ‘special product features’ that are critical and require manual splitting (slides, lifters, retractors). 5). Cimatron separates ‘special product features’ and allows for defining of individual UCS vectors for more precise feature splitting. 5). Cimatron deletes unused half, stitches, and heals usable half to within 0.001”. 5). User defines minimum allowable radius. 6). Cimatron selects and removes radii less than minimum radius. 7). User is allowed to manually manipulate the remaining surfaces and chooses to export. 8). Cimatron exports .*stl model in mold position with defined filename. The procedure is being tested internally to determine overall return on investment.  Refinement of this process will require some programming assistance from our ToolStats group. There is a high level of excitement when our engineering and programming groups converge on an innovative concept.  I can’t wait for the next breakthrough.

To take a look at how we currently do it, and how can we improve the process. I have found that YouTube has been a big help, take a look at some of the videos on there From the machines and cutter manufactures, some pretty mind blowing thing on there. A few examples are, faster cutting times, improved surface finish and expanding the use of the FCS Work holding System using their Guide Line Software.  Currently the FCS mounting holes Are primarily used in the larger components of a mold. So why not use them in smaller components, One example is lifters, as it is now once the tops are cut of the only way to hold and pick up the lifter Is by using the lifter bar.  Next time you walk by a CNC or EDM machine and they are setting up a lifter for an engineering change, just ask the operator and I’ll bet they will say that it is not the highlight of their day. Putting FCS in that lifter in the design phase will dramatically improve efficiently and accuracy. Although I/we haven’t tried all situations, but the ones that have been tried and tested worked excellent.  Again, with any change in process there will be trial and error.  Rev A, Rev B, etc… Currently, depending on the complexity of the block (2d, water, ejection) the designer must visually look for interferences when adding FCS.  That’s where The Guideline software comes in.  It takes that down to a few minutes. Once done in guide line, the locations with cutting object can seamlessly be put into the master design and model file.  Eliminating the need for “Hey, did you put the FCS in, where’s the file?” Last week the software was rolled out into the Lifter Cell and the HM600’s for further testing. Additional Cam software’s are being tested.  CamTool, PowerMill, Tebis and soon Cimatron V13. A few key points be evaluated are, Program calculation times, Surface Finish quality, ease of use and the learning curve.

A key initiative for this has been changing our standards and implementing automation to eliminate the need for associates to use knives or clippers to cut gates from parts. This effort starts up front in the product feasibility and tool design. Whenever possible, molds are designed with direct gates on the part, or are sub-gated to eliminate the need to trim gates all together. Still, there are situations where thick edge gates cannot be avoided. In these situations, Polymers is deploying sophisticated, robotically controlled “End of Arm Tooling” and/or secondary equipment to automatically remove the gates from the parts prior to the parts being conveyed to the associates. Many parts have multiple gates which would require associates to physically handle the parts and use a hand tool to remove the gates in the allotted cycle time. This adds complexity to the job for the associate. By taking this effort away from the associate, they can now focus on the quality of the part. With automated gate trimming, the gates are trimmed consistently every time, which improves the quality. Safety is always the number one consideration in everything we do. Removing sharp tools from the floor further protects our associates, as well as the parts. Proper Polymers Warren The Proper Polymers Warren expansion was complete in June.

This has not always been the case. Usually the prototype and production tooling divisions operated as separate entities, and there was little interface between the two groups. That is changing rapidly, as the two divisions are being blended together, and there is a much higher degree of work sharing between the groups. This blending of the two groups provides unparalleled opportunities for Proper Group International, offering advantages that were not previously available. They are as follows: • Supplements our manufacturing workload, and fills gaps in our schedule, when production tool build activity is light. Aids in keeping our workforce busy, while maintaining a consistent work schedule • Allows us to take on large prototype tooling programs, ranging from small to large tooling. In the past, the prototype division was hamstrung when it came to building larger tooling, due to machine size limitations and capabilities • As we are highly specialized in the design and manufacture of automotive lighting tooling, it gives us a leg up on our prototype competition, as most prototype shops do not possess our skillset or expertise. Many shy away, reducing the amount of competition vying for the same work • Many prototype tooling programs evolve, and we are selected to build the production tooling as well. This gives us a distinct advantage, as lessons learned from the prototype build are taken into account, and are applied to the production tooling build, which enable us to avoid the same pitfalls encountered in the prototype phase • A large portion of the prototype tool build process is geared towards making high quality molded parts, with expectations that the product produced mimics actual production parts. The selling price of the parts is oftentimes more significant than the price of the tooling • Bolsters the workload in our mold tryout area, whereas previously we were primarily dedicated to trialing new production tooling. More often than not, the number of prototype tool trials, exceeds the number of our production tool trials performed • Profitability on prototype tooling programs is significantly higher, when compared to production tooling build programs The blending of the two groups has been a success, and is good for Proper Group International. Look for more of the same type of activity going forward.

Training & Development The Human Resource team is working together and partnering with theMI/SC/TN and local colleges onmany training programs to assist Proper in our initiatives of Growing our Own Talent as we are “Committed to Your Success!” In recent events, Michigan’s HR team has partnered with MI Works for their continued efforts recruiting and training programs through Macomb’sWorkforce & Continuing Education team. After merely 1 week of partnership, and the success of the certification programs they offer, we hired 3 associates within our Warren facility. Coupled with the certificate and the Veteran Boot camp, we believe this will be a successful partnership for recruiting and training candidates. Going a little south to our South Carolina facility, in early 2015, the HR team partnered with Tri-County Technical College (TCTC). After the partnership was established, we quickly set up the Apprenticeship program for Mold Maker and are currently in the processes of reviewing a program for Process Technicians, Quality Engineers, as well as Maintenance Technicians.  We also established another partnership with MSSC Goodwill program in which we obtain candidates whom are going through a SCMC (South Carolina Manufacturing Certification) which are required to have 100 hours of On-the-Job training, to date this program has been a successful tool in growing our own talent. For further information about the certificate please visit: http:// www.sctechsystem.edu/scmc/about.htm. Last but not least, is our Tennessee facility, HR Manager, Amber Maiani, has meetings scheduled to search and establish an education/training facility for further advancement opportunities for our newly added proper associates to be able to enroll in a certified Department of Labor Apprenticeship Program.  Stay tuned for further information. If you would like to know more about the training programs Proper has to over please email us at HR@propergroupintl. com. HR values the opportunity to speak with you, hear your goals, and see how we may line them up with our advancement opportunities. Congratulations to Todd Puchovan and Alex Koles for Graduating the Michigan Applied Technical Training (Apprentice) program.","@ID":24},{"#text":"2  | Proper Letter from the CEO October is the start of our final quarter of 2016.  The first three quarters of this year have been a challenge for our company. From delays on tooling programs, managing the expansion and construction of three locations, pre-launch of the BMW GO1 & GO2 program, and changes to our organization to support the growth of our company have been very disruptive to our team. This quarter will no doubt improve. The Tooling Group with plenty of new projects, starting and carrying well into 2017 will keep this group very busy.  Equally benefiting this is our Polymer Group, which has many new programs to launch as well as servicing strong orders from current business. As you read the articles, I hope you see the great progress our team is doing in improving, changing, developing and creating a great manufacturing organization that supports the ever changing business landscape.  As October closes and our Presidential election finally concludes, we can begin to get back to some normalcy in our lives. This is a great time of year to enjoy the colored landscape, football, the World Series, and apple cider with your favorite family variations.
