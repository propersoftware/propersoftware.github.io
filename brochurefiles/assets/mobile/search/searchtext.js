Although, we don’t have quite the same level of craziness now, we are still quite busy in Tooling and Polymers. To give you some idea, I thought I would provide some stats: Through July, Proper Group sales are approximately 25% higher than in 2016. Much of this was fueled by high tooling sales at Proper Tooling and Proper Polymers. Year to date, Proper Tooling has been awarded over $26 Million in new business. The new Tooling business awards are lower than projected due to the large amount of tooling business in the pipeline early in the year. The awards have picked up and we expect a fast finish into the 3rd and 4th quarter this year. To ensure we do not create another overload situation in tooling, the sales and operations teams are meeting weekly to review the current pipeline and new business backlog. Proper E has been an instrumental tool to gage our forward capacity in tooling. On the production molding side, Proper Polymers has been awarded over $10 million annually in new business. This equates to over $45 million in lifetime sales, not including tooling associated with these new programs. Currently, Proper Polymers has 24 program launches in the process. These launches are for 9 different customers, across 18 vehicle platforms.  We have a diverse business at the OEM level as well. The programs are for BMW, Mercedes, Ram Truck, Jeep, Tesla, Lincoln, Ford, Audi, General Motors, Nissan and Hino Truck. So far this year, we have acquired 6 new customers, including JW Speaker, Whelen, HMS Home Products, Bosch Rexroth, Valeo Lighting (Polymers) and Pacific Insight. In addition to these new customers, Proper has been awarded our first new program from Plastic Omnium in nearly 10 years. This is very important as Plastic Omnium is building a new facility in SC to support future BMW exterior platforms. The business we have been awarded includes 6 molds which will require MuCell. After all the years of development tools and trials conducted at Proper Tooling, we have our first production opportunity with MuCell. We expect this to be a growing trend as the OEM’s continue to light weight their vehicles. We have a couple of organizational announcements within the Business Development Group. Jay Tobin joined Proper in April. Jay is now the Proper Polymers Director of Sales for Lighting. Jay comes to Proper from Federal Mogul where he spent many years leading the sales in their lighting division. Also, Dan Dare has taken on a new, very important, role as the Vice President of Program Development over all of Polymers Program Management. This change will ensure a consistent level of leadership and adherence to our standards and procedures for new program launches.

We track and measure ticket resolution to ensure optimal service is provided in a timely fashion.  Tickets are now able to be placed by phone, email, mobile app, or directly using the IT Service Desk Portal web page. The system categorizes all technological service incidents, including escalated events.  An “incident” is our word for anything that denotes the failure or degradation of an IT service. For example, unable to print, unable to receive e-mails and so on.  Service Requests, on the other hand, are requests raised by the user for support, delivery, information, advice or documentation. Some examples are installing software in workstations, resetting lost password, requesting for hardware device and so on. Proper ITTechnicianswill respond to your ticket with awhole teamapproach, versus strictly a local site approach to ensure your ticket is resolved in the best possible manner according to the established service levels.  It serves as our IT scorecard to track performance and analyze recurring problems, document root causes and build a knowledge base to help avoid and resolve future incidents. Enhancements to the current process: 1. The Service Desk web address will be changed to servicedesk. propergroupintl.com so that it is easily remembered and accessible. 2. All requests must be tickets in Service Desk to compose a score card. 3. An internal help desk phone extension (x9123) is reachable by all sites and associates. The help desk operator will create your request in Service Desk and assign it to an available technician. 4. An add-on for Outlook will be created that can easily create a ticket by email in Service Desk. 5. A knowledge base of user-friendly solutions will be created in Service Desk, readily available to all associates.  Access the knowledge base by clicking on Solutions at the top. 6. Incidents will be classified much differently to strictly adhere to SLA times, improving reliability We believe these changes will improve the IT department’s overall performance and provide better accountability across all requests, but it all depends on each associate’s willingness to adapt to these new procedures.

If you have ever looked through a pair of polarized sunglasses at a Pontiac windshield, you may have seen the purple haze caused by resin laminated between layers of glass.  This optical property is defined by how light refracts through a material and is tied with the term ‘polarization’.  Essentially, a ray of light may travel at a faster speed thru one path of a material, and slower speeds through another path.  How light passes through an object is referred to as refraction.  This can be seen when we look at larger PC headlamps that appear to have a ‘rainbow effect’ under intense sunlight.  This display of color is directly related to ‘molded-in-stress’ and molecular orientation.  The PC lens in the image below shows a ray of purple stemming from high stress at the gate.  Areas of lower stress appear more yellow.  In the near future, automotive quality standards will not accept this condition in molded optical product. LSR is molded with much lower pressures, exhibit a constant light transmission, and have an excellent refractive index for optical applications. Injection Molding LSR The process of injection molding LSR has some distinct differences to that of molding thermoplastic polymers.  LSR cures through a chemical reaction, meaning that an A component and B component are mixed 1:1 to trigger the curing process. Curing is accelerated by heating of the injection mold.  The injection molding equipment also has some distant differences. The image below shows a metering unit that conveys the A and B components to a mix head for injection into the mold. The mixing unit is cooled to stifle the chemical reaction.  This equipment can be equip with stand injection barrels as well for use in two shot over-molding applications. The Future of Lighting Automotive OEM’s are on the hunt for the next innovative technology.  One of our primary lighting customers Hella, has already started the movement.  Below is a rendered image of the next generation headlamp with LSR inner lens components, and the first to hit production in the automotive headlamp market space.  The demand for this technology is moving at an incredible pace. Proper Group is working diligently to stay ‘ahead of the curve’ to be a major player in this incredible technology.  The future is at our fingertips.   Challenge accepted!

Interesting enough, PC and PMMA replaced traditional materials such as glass due to processing cost advantages, reduced weight, and design flexibility.  These materials are now facing some competition of their own with advancements in LSR chemistry that providebenefits inareaswherePCandPMMA (thermoplastic polymers) are restricted.  LED lighting technology is creating a demand for highly engineered materials that are resistant to high temperatures, UV light, and blue light radiation.  Optical clarity is also an important factor in polymer selection for optical engineers.  LED grade PC for example has an average optical clarity transmission percentage of 90% (at 2mm thick).  While new grades of optical grade LSR are pushing the boundaries with transmission of 94% under the same testing methods.  The image below is an example of an LSR lens.  LSR suppliers are claiming this material can be molded as thick as 45mm. Liquid Silicone Rubber - The Automotive Frontier Introduction to LSR Liquid silicone rubber (LSR) is a two component polymer that falls under the ‘elastomer’ family.  This material has similar characteristics to that of rubber, but can be produced in a multitude of colors, including crystal clear.  This elastomer has been used in medical and consumer products for decades including catheters, medical tubes, pacifiers, baby bottle nipples, and kitchen spatulas to name a few.  The automotive industry is currently using this technology for under hood and electrical applications due to high thermal resistance.  LSR can be over-molded to thermoplastic resins and chemical bond with polymers such as nylon to create structural components with a chemically resistant soft seal. The automotive lighting industry is finding innovative ways to make use of this technology, and it starts with polymer chemistry.","@ID":10},{"#text":"Proper |  3 Contents 4 PGI Business Development 5 Proper Tooling 6 Proper Polymers - Anderson 8 PGI Optics 9 Proper Tooling Sales 10 Proper Innovation - LSR 12 Proper IT 14 ToolStats 16 PGI Programming 18 Cutting Edge Precision Services 19 PGI Machining 20 2017 AMBA Scholarship 21 HR / Benefits 24 Proper Polymers - Greenville 26 Proper Prototype","@ID":3},{"#text":"26  | Proper Prototype Proper Prototype Autonomous Car / Driverless Car The automotive industry is spending a lot of time these days thinking about the future and what it will take to create the City of Tomorrow.

The rest of the machining departments will follow suit shortly. Our December through February deliveries will be heavy – perfect time of year for increased workload! Almost a year to the day, I have been in the position of General Manager at Proper Tooling.  It has been a crazy, fast year with a lot to learn and I look forward to many more to come.  Proper is growing at a rapid pace, adding new equipment and job opportunities, which are all great indicators this is a great company to work for.  I would like to thank ownership for the opportunity and all associates for their continued support.

We are starting to see the decline of the F25 BMW Program and starting to see the G01 BMW Program materialize.  To facilitate quality and cost out improvements, we are reviewing cell layouts, operator utilization, degating, short shot sensors and other devices to poke-yoke processes so there is process and quality repeatability. We have started the process of refurbishing the building with rest rooms and the shop floor, which are beginning to show a little age.  More to show in upcoming newsletters!  PPA relocated the PPA Tooling are to its new area adjacent to Press 23. Proper associates were treated with an employee outing of grilling food, games and prizes on August 21st during the Solar Eclipse.  This was appreciated and enjoyed by all.  During the eclipse, we announced the potential new business with Yeti Coolers and Otterbox Coolers.  Both Yeti and Otterbox visited PPA recently and were favorably impressed, enough to begin discussions about our capabilities.

Our new Greenville plant began its launch of the new BMW X3 Program.  As you can imagine with a new plant, new people, and your customer 100 yards away, this can be strenuous.  The group worked extremely well, and they are making great progress to meet the expectations of both Magna and BMW. Included in this launch was our most mature plant – Anderson, and they performed well with their seasoned team.  On a recent visit to Munich with key individuals of the BMW organization, I was told howwell our teamperformed andwe seem towork well with our Tier 1 customers.  They thought we should continue to build a strong alliance with BMW because of the team’s excellent performance.  I can begin to see this, as we see potential new opportunities arise for other Tier 1 suppliers to BMW. Pulaski is going through their own launch activities with the introduction of our first full fog lamp assembly.  They are adding hard coat painting and gluing capabilities during this launch. They also have 5 other product launches this quarter and will be working extremely hard during this time.  Initial indications are very positive and the team is doing a wonderful  job. Warren, our Otterbox plant, is past the launch phase.  They are hitting on all cylinders and are producing complete coolers in three sizes.  This team has just been awarded the global sourcing contract to manufacture these coolers for the world.  So any Otterbox cooler around the world will be produced by Proper. A new plant expansion is required to increase the volume by Mid 2018. Our tooling group continues to climb out of the extremely busy time from earlier this year. With our new IT director, David Hahn, we are adding software and resources to better plan and schedule our work load.  This should be active in Q1 2018.  Along with initiative, we will begin an in house training program to train the next generation of moldmakers. We will start slow, with the plan to train 15 people per year within the next two years. The cold air is finally here and football is in full swing.  Soon we will have the holidays and time to reflect on the past year.  Spend time with family and friends and think of tomorrow.  I wish you all a good holiday. Geoff O’Brien CEO S E R I E S 2","@ID":2}]}}
